# Validates that .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml contains a job named
# exactly `copilot-setup-steps`. GitHub's Copilot cloud agent only picks up the
# file when this exact job name is present; a missing/renamed job silently
# disables the bootstrap. The org weekly compliance audit flags this as the
# `copilot-setup-steps-invalid-job-name` error — this guard catches a regression
# in PR CI instead of waiting for the next audit.
#
# Detection mirrors the org audit (petry-projects/.github
# scripts/compliance-audit.sh): an indentation-based parser, not a loose grep,
# so comments or similarly named keys elsewhere cannot falsely satisfy it.
