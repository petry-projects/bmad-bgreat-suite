#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Validates that the dependency-audit workflow keeps producing the
# "dependency-audit / Detect ecosystems" required status check enforced by the
# code-quality ruleset (compliance: ruleset-drift-code-quality-required_status_checks,
# issue #388).
#
# The codified ruleset (petry-projects/.github → standards/rulesets/code-quality.json)
# requires the context "dependency-audit / Detect ecosystems". A GitHub check
# context from a reusable-workflow caller is "<caller-job-id> / <reusable-job-name>",
# so that exact context is produced only when:
#   - a job with id "dependency-audit" exists in this workflow, and
#   - it calls the org reusable dependency-audit-reusable.yml (whose "detect"
#     job is named "Detect ecosystems").
# If either half drifts (job renamed, uses: changed, workflow deleted, or the
# PR trigger dropped so the check never runs), the required check becomes
# unsatisfiable and every merge to main is blocked. This guard catches that in
# PR CI instead of waiting for the next weekly compliance audit.
#
# Usage: bash tools/test-dependency-audit-check.sh [workflow-file]
#   workflow-file  Path to the dependency-audit workflow.
#                  Defaults to .github/workflows/dependency-audit.yml.
