## 1. Overview

- **Project**:

- **Created**:
- **Last Updated**:

## 2. Workflow Completion Status

| Workflow | Status | Completion Date | Output Document | Completed By |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Observability Plan | Not Started | | | |
| Incident Response Plan | Not Started | | | |
| Infrastructure Plan | Not Started | | | |
| CI/CD Pipeline Plan | Not Started | | | |

### 2.1 Observability Plan

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Completion Date**:
- **Output Document**:
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Metrics backend:
  - Logging backend:
  - Tracing approach:
  - SLO targets defined:
- **Cross-References**:
  - Alerting strategy informs Incident Response severity classification
  - SLO/SLI definitions inform Infrastructure scaling requirements
  - Dashboard requirements inform Pipeline post-deploy verification

### 2.2 Incident Response Plan

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Completion Date**:
- **Output Document**:
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Severity levels defined:
  - On-call rotation model:
  - Postmortem process:
  - Communication templates:
- **Cross-References**:
  - Severity classification aligned with Observability alerting thresholds
  - Runbook procedures reference Infrastructure topology
  - Escalation paths account for Pipeline rollback procedures

### 2.3 Infrastructure Plan

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Completion Date**:
- **Output Document**:
- **Key Decisions**:
  - IaC tool:
  - Cloud provider:
  - Container orchestration:
  - Environment topology:
- **Cross-References**:
  - Environment topology informs Pipeline deployment targets
  - Network architecture supports Observability agent deployment
  - Secrets management integrates with Pipeline credential injection

### 2.4 CI/CD Pipeline Plan

- **Status**: Not Started
- **Completion Date**:
- **Output Document**:
- **Key Decisions**:
  - CI/CD platform:
  - Branching strategy:
  - Deployment strategy:
  - Security scanning approach:
- **Cross-References**:
  - Deployment targets align with Infrastructure environment topology
  - Post-deploy verification uses Observability health checks
  - Rollback procedures align with Incident Response escalation

## 3. Overall Readiness Assessment

### 3.1 Readiness Gate

| Criterion | Met? | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| All 4 workflow plans completed | | |
| Cross-plan references are consistent | | |
| No critical gaps identified | | |
| Key decisions align across plans | | |

### 3.2 Readiness Status

**Overall Status**: NOT READY

> Update this status to READY when all four workflow plans are complete, cross-references are consistent, and no critical gaps remain.

## 4. Gap Analysis

### 4.1 Cross-Plan Dependency Gaps

> Identified when a workflow references a decision or artifact from another plan that is missing, inconsistent, or contradictory.

| Gap | Source Plan | Depends On | Severity | Resolution |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|------------|

### 4.2 Coverage Gaps

> Areas where no workflow plan addresses a production readiness concern.

| Gap | Expected Coverage | Recommendation |
|-----|------------------|----------------|

### 4.3 Consistency Issues

> Decisions made in one plan that conflict with decisions in another.

| Issue | Plan A Decision | Plan B Decision | Resolution |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|------------|

## 5. Recommended Completion Order

The following order maximizes context sharing between workflows:

1. **Observability Plan** -- Establishes metrics strategy, SLOs, and alerting that inform all other plans
2. **Incident Response Plan** -- Builds on Observability alerting to define severity, escalation, and runbooks
3. **Infrastructure Plan** -- References Observability for monitoring targets and Incident Response for operational procedures
4. **CI/CD Pipeline Plan** -- References Infrastructure for deployment targets and Observability for verification gates
