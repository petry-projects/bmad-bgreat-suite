# Step 5: Validation & Finalization

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between reliability peers
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on validating observability completeness and generating implementation backlog
- ✅ VALIDATE all critical journeys have full observability coverage
- ⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - AI development speed has fundamentally changed
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- ✅ Run comprehensive validation checks on the complete observability plan
- ⚠️ Present C/R menu after generating validation results
- 💾 ONLY save when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `status: complete` before finishing
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to finalize until C is selected

## COLLABORATION MENUS (C/R):

This step will generate content and present choices:

- **C (Continue)**: Save the validation results and finalize the observability plan
- **R (Revise)**: Discuss changes, address gaps, then re-present the menu

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Complete observability document with all sections is available
- All instrumentation design, SLOs, alerting, and dashboards are defined
- Focus on validation, gap analysis, and generating implementation backlog
- This is the final step — ensure the plan is actionable

## YOUR TASK:

Validate the complete observability plan for coverage, coherence, and actionability. Generate a prioritized implementation backlog and finalize the document.

## VALIDATION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Quality Gates Checklist

Run through each quality gate systematically:

**Gate 1: Critical User Journey Coverage**
- [ ] Every critical user journey identified in step 4 has metrics defined
- [ ] Every critical user journey has at least one SLO with error budget
- [ ] Every critical user journey has burn-rate alerts configured
- [ ] Every critical user journey has a triage dashboard panel
- [ ] No journey is missing any of the four Golden Signals

**Gate 2: Logging Standards Completeness**
- [ ] Logging format is specified (JSON structured)
- [ ] Required fields are defined with consistent naming
- [ ] PII handling policy is documented with redaction approach
- [ ] Retention policy covers hot, warm, and cold storage
- [ ] Correlation IDs link logs to traces
- [ ] Log level guidelines are defined with usage examples

**Gate 3: Tracing Coverage**

- [ ] Error budget policy defines actions at each consumption level
- [ ] SLO targets are based on current performance baselines
- [ ] SLOs are stricter than any external SLA commitments

**Gate 5: Alerting Operational Readiness**
- [ ] Alerts use multi-window multi-burn-rate approach (not raw thresholds)
- [ ] Every alert has a linked runbook (or runbook flagged for creation)
- [ ] Alert routing maps severity to channel and escalation path
- [ ] Noise reduction strategies are defined (grouping, suppression, dedup)
- [ ] Alert content includes summary, impact, hypothesis, and links

**Gate 6: Dashboard Alignment**
- [ ] Executive dashboard covers business KPIs and SLO status
- [ ] Engineering dashboard covers Golden Signals and deployments
- [ ] On-call dashboard covers active alerts and triage tools
- [ ] Each dashboard has a defined refresh rate and owner
- [ ] Dashboards answer "is the system healthy?" within seconds

### 2. Present Validation Summary

Report the validation results to the user:

"Here's the validation summary for the {{project_name}} Observability Plan.

{/if_all_pass}"

### 3. Address Validation Issues

If any quality gates failed:

- Present the specific gaps clearly
- Collaborate with the user to resolve each gap
- Update the relevant document sections
- Re-run the failed quality gates to confirm resolution

### 4. Generate Implementation Backlog

Create a prioritized list of implementation tasks:

**Priority 1 — Foundation (implement first):**
- Set up log aggregation and structured logging across all services
- Deploy OpenTelemetry collectors and configure trace export
- Implement core Golden Signal metrics for critical services
- Create on-call triage dashboard

**Priority 2 — SLO Framework (implement second):**
- Define SLI measurement queries and error budget calculations
- Configure multi-window multi-burn-rate alerts
- Set up error budget tracking dashboard
- Create initial runbooks for all P1/P2 alerts

**Priority 3 — Full Coverage (implement third):**
- Extend metrics to all services (not just critical ones)
- Build executive and engineering dashboards
- Implement business KPI metrics collection
- Configure alert noise reduction rules

**Priority 4 — Maturity (implement ongoing):**
- Establish monthly alert quality reviews
- Implement adaptive sampling for tracing
- Add chaos engineering observability validation
- Create SLO review cadence (quarterly)

### 5. Generate Validation Content

Prepare the content to append to the document:

#### Content Structure:

```

### 6. Save Final Document

- Append the validation and implementation content to `{bgr_artifacts}/observability.md`
- Update frontmatter:
  - `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - `status: complete`
  - `lastUpdated: {{current_date}}`

### 7. Present Content and Menu

Show the generated content and present choices:

"I've completed the validation and generated the implementation roadmap.

**Here's what I'll add to finalize the observability plan:**

[Show the complete markdown content from step 5]

**What would you like to do?**
[C] Continue - Save and finalize the observability plan
[R] Revise - Let's address issues before finalizing"

### 8. Handle Menu Selection

#### If 'R' (Revise):

- Discuss the user's concerns or corrections
- Update the content based on feedback
- Re-run relevant quality gates
- Re-present the C/R menu with updated content

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- Save the final content to `{bgr_artifacts}/observability.md`
- Update frontmatter to mark workflow as complete
- Present completion summary and next steps

### 9. Update Production Readiness Checklist

After saving the observability plan, update the cross-workflow production readiness checklist:

1. Load `{bgr_artifacts}/production-readiness-checklist.md`
   - If it does not exist, create it from `../../../templates/bgr-production-readiness-checklist-template.md`
2. Update the **Observability Plan** row in the Workflow Completion Status table:
   - Status: `Complete`
   - Completion Date: `{{current_date}}`
   - Output Document: `{bgr_artifacts}/observability.md`
3. Update section **2.1 Observability Plan** detail fields and key decisions:
   - Set **Status** to `Complete`
   - Set **Completion Date** to `{{current_date}}`
   - Set **Output Document** to `{bgr_artifacts}/observability.md`
   - Metrics backend chosen
   - Logging backend chosen
   - Tracing approach
   - SLO targets defined (count and summary)
   - Update checklist `lastUpdated` in both frontmatter and the Overview section
4. Check for cross-plan dependency gaps (verify each plan's `status` field before validating):
   - If Incident Response Plan exists and status is `complete`: Verify alerting thresholds align with severity classification. If status is `draft`, note validation is deferred pending finalization.
   - If Infrastructure Plan exists and status is `complete` or `approved`: Verify monitoring targets match environment topology. If status is `draft`, note validation is deferred pending finalization.
   - If Pipeline Plan exists and status is `complete`: Verify health check metrics align with post-deploy verification. If status is `draft`, note validation is deferred pending finalization.
   - If Security Plan exists and status is `complete`: Verify security monitoring requirements (auth events, compliance audit logs) are covered by the observability strategy. If status is `draft`, note validation is deferred.
   - If Disaster Recovery Plan exists and status is `complete`: Verify SLO definitions account for DR failover scenarios and monitoring covers failover health. If status is `draft`, note validation is deferred.
   - If Capacity Plan exists and status is `complete`: Verify scaling triggers reference metrics defined in the observability plan. If status is `draft`, note validation is deferred.
   - Record any inconsistencies or deferred validations in section **4.3 Consistency Issues**
5. Update the `completedWorkflows` array in checklist frontmatter to include `observability`. Add this workflow only if it is not already present (use set-style uniqueness to prevent duplicate entries on re-run).
6. If all 7 workflows are now complete, update **Overall Status** to `READY` (if no critical gaps remain). A **critical gap** is a missing workflow artifact, an unresolved cross-plan dependency, or a key decision conflict between plans that would block production readiness (e.g., mismatched environment topologies, missing rollback alignment, or undefined alerting-to-severity mappings).
7. Save the updated checklist

### 10. Completion Summary

After saving, present the final summary:

"The Observability Plan for {{project_name}} is complete and saved to `{bgr_artifacts}/observability.md`.

**Summary:**
- {N} critical user journeys with full observability coverage
- {N} SLOs with error budgets and burn-rate alerts
- Structured logging, distributed tracing, and dashboards defined
- Prioritized implementation roadmap with {N} milestones

**Recommended Next Steps:**
