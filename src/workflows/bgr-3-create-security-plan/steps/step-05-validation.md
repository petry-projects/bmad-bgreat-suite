# Step 5: Validation & Finalization

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input

- 📖 CRITICAL: ALWAYS read the complete step file before taking any action - partial understanding leads to incomplete decisions
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure the entire file is read and understood before proceeding
- ✅ ALWAYS treat this as collaborative discovery between security peers
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- 💬 FOCUS on validating completeness and coherence of the security plan
- ✅ VALIDATE all critical areas are covered before finalizing
- ⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - AI development speed has fundamentally changed
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Show your analysis before taking any action
- ✅ Run comprehensive validation checks on the complete plan
- ⚠️ Present [C]ontinue / [R]evise menu after generating validation results
- 💾 ONLY save when user chooses C (Continue)
- 📖 Update frontmatter `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and set `status: complete` before finalizing
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to finalize until C is selected

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Complete security plan with all sections is available
- All threat modeling, security controls, and compliance mapping are defined
- Focus on validation, gap analysis, and completeness checking
- Prepare for handoff to implementation

## YOUR TASK:

Validate the complete security plan for coherence, completeness, and implementation readiness. Present a summary and finalize the document.

## VALIDATION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Quality Gates Checklist

Run through each quality gate and assess pass/fail:

**Threat Modeling:**
- [ ] System assets identified and data classified

- [ ] Gaps identified with risk levels
- [ ] Remediation roadmap prioritized

### 2. Coherence Validation

Check that all sections work together:

- Do security controls address every critical/high threat from the threat matrix?
- Does the auth strategy align with data classification requirements?
- Do network controls match the architecture's trust boundaries?
- Is the compliance mapping consistent with the controls actually defined?
- Does the security testing strategy cover the highest-risk areas?
- Are secret management practices consistent across development and production?

### 3. Gap Analysis

Identify any missing elements:

**Critical Gaps** (block production readiness):
- Unaddressed critical threats from the threat matrix
- Missing authentication for trust boundary crossings
- Sensitive data without encryption controls
- Compliance requirements without mapped controls

**Important Gaps** (should be addressed soon):
- Security testing not yet integrated into CI
- Manual secret management processes
- Incomplete compliance mapping for applicable frameworks

**Enhancement Opportunities** (improve over time):
- Advanced threat detection and anomaly monitoring
- Security chaos engineering
- Automated compliance evidence collection
- Red team exercises

### 4. Implementation Sequence

Define the recommended order of security implementation:

**Phase 1 — Foundation (before production):**
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Secret management setup
- Basic network segmentation
- SAST and SCA in CI pipeline

**Phase 2 — Hardening (first quarter):**
- Complete network micro-segmentation
- DAST integration
- Container security hardening
- Dependency update automation
- Security review gates for high-risk changes

**Phase 3 — Maturity (ongoing):**
- Zero-trust architecture rollout
- SBOM and supply chain verification
- Compliance evidence automation
- Penetration testing program
- Security metrics and reporting

### 5. Present Validation Summary

Present the complete validation to user:

"I've completed a comprehensive validation of your Security Plan.

**Quality Gates:**

Show the generated content and present choices:

"I've completed the validation. Here's the final section to add:

[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]

**What would you like to do?**
[C] Continue - Save and finalize the security plan
[R] Revise - Let's address gaps or adjust any section of the plan"

### 8. Handle Menu Selection

#### If 'R' (Revise):

- Ask what specific areas need adjustment
- Navigate back to relevant sections if needed
- Collaborate on revisions
- Re-run validation if significant changes made
- Present updated content
- Return to [C]/[R] menu

#### If 'C' (Continue):

- Append the final content to `{bgr_artifacts}/security-plan.md`
- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Update frontmatter: `status: complete`
- Update frontmatter: `lastUpdated` to current date
- Save the final document

### 9. Finalization Report

After saving, present the completion summary:

"Your Security Plan is complete and saved to `{bgr_artifacts}/security-plan.md`.

**What you have:**
- Asset inventory and data classification
- Trust boundary mapping and attack surface analysis
- STRIDE threat model with prioritized threat matrix
- Authentication and authorization strategy
- Data protection controls aligned with classification
- Network security posture with zero-trust principles
- Secret management strategy with lifecycle policies
- Supply chain security controls
- Security testing strategy integrated into CI/CD
- Compliance mapping to applicable regulatory frameworks
- Gap analysis with prioritized remediation roadmap
- Phased implementation sequence

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Implement Phase 1 security controls before production launch
2. Set up security scanning in your CI/CD pipeline (use Riley's `bgr-3-create-pipeline` workflow)
3. Configure security-relevant observability (use Morgan's `bgr-3-create-observability` workflow)
4. Create incident response procedures for security events (use Morgan's `bgr-3-create-incident-response` workflow)
5. Schedule your first penetration test
6. Share this plan with the team and get feedback

**Integration with other agents:**
- **Morgan (SRE)**: Security observability, security incident response procedures, post-incident security review
- **Riley (DevOps)**: Pipeline security scanning, infrastructure hardening, container security

Thank you for building this plan together, {{user_name}}! A security plan is only as good as its implementation — the phased approach ensures you build on a solid foundation without trying to boil the ocean."

## SUCCESS METRICS:

✅ All quality gates evaluated with clear pass/fail
✅ Coherence between all sections validated
✅ Gaps identified and communicated with priority levels
✅ Implementation sequence defined in practical phases
✅ Final document saved with complete frontmatter
✅ Actionable next steps provided with cross-agent integration points
✅ [C]/[R] menu presented and handled correctly
✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected

## FAILURE MODES:

❌ Rubber-stamping validation without thorough checks
❌ Missing critical gaps that would leave the system vulnerable
❌ Not checking coherence between threat model and controls
❌ Finalizing without user confirmation
❌ Not providing actionable implementation sequence
❌ Not presenting [C]/[R] menu after content generation

❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions
❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file
❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols

## WORKFLOW COMPLETE:

This is the final step. After finalization, the security plan workflow is complete. The user can invoke additional workflows or return to the agent menu.
